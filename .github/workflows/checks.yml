# This workflow performs basic checks:
#
#   1. run a preparation step to install and cache node modules
#   2. once prep succeeds, lint and test run in parallel
#
# The checks only run on non-draft Pull Requests. They don't run on the main
# branch prior to deploy. It's recommended to use branch protection to avoid
# pushes straight to 'main'.
